Contents of the readme: 1- How and what the goal exactly is of my journey. 2- Notes i take while learning , and notes about the code 3- Error and problems i faced and how i fixed them
4- My thoughts about the project at the end of the project and what i plan to do next


1----------------------------------------- THE GOAL EXPLAINED IN DETAILS:

First of all i'm a second grade student at Gazi University. I want to see what ai is about and learn more about the subject. This is my official third project about ai. my first experience was within a compition named Teknofest. Agter gaining interest in AI i'm willing to learn more about this topic and i think the best way to do that is through projects. So this is my second YouTube based project. While learning i also intend to get a fuller GitHub page. So that's a double win-win. After finishing the project i intend to continue the YouTube playlist if it apeals to me and my goals.


2----------------------------------------- CODING NOTES:
This time i'm goingto try and use jupiter notebook instead of a direct python program. If this benifits the code more and is easier to use than i will contineu with jupiter Notebook.
My reason to try JNB is so i don't have to comment out coding parts that i do not to need use twice. Because if i have to comment out parts than that can become
confusing if i read the code in the future again. 

3----------------------------------------- ERRORS:
There we're no major error is occurd with during the project.
Everything went pretty smooth.

4----------------------------------------- Thoughts:
Ofcourse i got a better understanding of the project and learned new things.
Ä° need to weekly read my previous project again (it wont take 10  mins) just to remember some key features and to not forget the new things i've learned through out my journey.
